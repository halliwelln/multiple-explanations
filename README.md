Loading the FrenchRoyalty-200k is as simple as decompressing the french_royalty.npz.zip file and using the utils.get_data function:

```python
print('hello world')

```

First build a conda environment which uses Python 3.7 and Tensorflow-GPU 2.3:
```
conda env create -f kg_env.yml --name kg_env
```
